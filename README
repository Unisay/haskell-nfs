Haskell tools and library for interacting with ONC RPC (aka Sun RPC) protocols.
The eventual goal is a working NFS4 client, so TCP clients and efficient large
data handling will be prioritized over servers, UDP, and portmaping.

See also http://github.com/jthornber/xdrgen, which is a rpcgen replacement for
other languages, written in Haskell.  By contrast, this project targets full RPC
support in Haskell (however the Haskell XDR generator could fit in that project).
